Periodic Table:

This is the Periodic Table assignment made interactive.

Open the page, click away the header and drag'n'drop elements to the side/bottom of the page to see details

This was done with:
CSS
jQuery/javascript
jQuery UI

The content resizes according to the window (though it doesn't look good or legible!!!)

The Periodic Table data was taken from http://php.scripts.psu.edu/djh300/cmpsc221/p3s11-pt-data.htm

Any and all comments/reviews are welcome
